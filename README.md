With the world of tech constantly growing and evolving, it only makes sense for us developers to want to have discussions with one another on everything coding. Starting from scratch, we were able to construct a website using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm that acts as a CSM-style blog site. Users can post blogs, then view and edit them, as well as comment on them afterward. With basic logging in and out functionality as well, using the website is extremely user-friendly. Handlebars was utilized for the HTML elements of this project.
